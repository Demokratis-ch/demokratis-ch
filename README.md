# Demokratis.ch
[Demokratis.ch](https://demokratis.ch) makes it easier to participate in Swiss consultation procedures in order to better influence the legislative process at Federal and Cantonal level.

### About
The consultation procedure is a fundamental, but lesser known integral part of Swiss democracy. While in theory the consultation procedure is open to everyone the barriers to participation are rather high. Demokratis.ch is an accessible and user-friendly web platform which makes it easy to explore, contribute to and monitor consultation procedures in Switzerland.

Demokratis is developed and run by a Swiss association ("Verein") with the same name and you are most welcome to join us!

## How to contribute
We are a community project, still in its early stages and very much looking forward to your contributions! If you're unsure how to get started, [get in touch with us](mailto:team@demokratis.ch).

### Code & Design
The code of the platform is open source - take a look at our open issues, contribute a PR, suggest features, report bugs or improve our technical documentation. Take a look at the setup instructions below to get started.

The current UI is very basic and we are very open for inputs and help to improve it.

### Content
Want to help us out with content? We are most interested in contributions that
* document the platform and its usage;
* add relevant organisations and initiatives;
* explain the consultation procedure in Switzerland and how to participate in it.

### Contacts
Are there organisations you care about that are not yet on the platform? Let us know and we'll reach out to them. The same goes for any other Swiss associations or initiatives that are working on similar topics!

### Finance
Are you able to contribute financially to the costs of running the platform? Are you able to introduce us to potential sponsors? We are very interested in hearing from you! 


## Tech
The platform is built with a classic LAMP stack and uses the [Symfony](https://symfony.com) framework as well as [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
